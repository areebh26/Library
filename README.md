# 📚 Library App

A simple yet functional library application built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.
This project is part of The Odin Project's JavaScript curriculum. It demonstrates the use of objects, object constructors, and the DOM manipulation to manage a collection of books.

 ## 🔗 Live Demo

 ## ✨ Features

- **Add New Books:** Users can input book details (Title, Author, Pages, Read Status) via a dynamic form.
- **View Library:** Displays all books in a responsive grid/table layout.
- **Toggle Read Status:** Interactive button to switch a book's status between "Read" and "Not Read" directly on the book card.
- **Remove Books:** Option to delete specific books from the library collection.
- **Input Validation:** Prevents empty or invalid entries from being added to the library.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** - Semantic structure of the application.
- **CSS3** - Custom styling (Flexbox/Grid) for a responsive design.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** - Logic for the library, including:
  - Object Constructors & Prototypes
  - DOM Manipulation
  - Event Listeners

## 🧠 Concepts Applied

This project focuses on the following JavaScript concepts:
1.  **Object Constructors:** Storing book data within initialized objects.
2.  **Prototypes:** Adding methods (like toggling read status) to the Book prototype to save memory.
3.  **Arrays:** Managing the collection of Book objects.
4.  **Looping:** Iterating through the library array to render the DOM elements.
5.  **Data Attributes:** Using `data-index` or unique IDs to associate DOM elements with their corresponding logic objects.
